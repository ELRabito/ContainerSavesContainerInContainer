# ContainerSavesContainerInContainer


This will fix the issue that containers with containers inside (backpack inside backpack etc) inside containers/vehicles are vanishing on restart.

**Warning**: Since there could be issues while loading containers/vehicles, test it before you apply it to a live server and make backups!

Before restart and putting the backpack into the vehicle.
